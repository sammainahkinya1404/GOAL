‚úÖ Types of Queuing Systems with Descriptions & Sample Projects
1. Single-Server Queue (M/M/1)
Description:
A basic model with one server, exponential interarrival and service times. Customers wait in a single line.

Applications: Bank teller, Helpdesk, Single cashier.

Project:
Simulate a Bank Queue System

Use Python or Simul8 to model arrival of customers and average wait time.

Measure system utilization, average queue length, and waiting time.

2. Multi-Server Queue (M/M/c)
Description:
Multiple servers (e.g., c = 3), exponential arrival/service times. All customers wait in one queue and go to the next available server.

Applications: Airport check-in, hospital triage.

Project:
Simulate an Airport Check-in Counter

Simulate passenger arrivals to 3 check-in counters.

Compare customer wait times with different numbers of servers (c).

3. Finite Queue (M/M/1/K or M/M/c/K)
Description:
A queue system with limited buffer or capacity 
ùêæ
K. If the queue is full, new arrivals are rejected or lost.

Applications: Network routers, toll booths.

Project:
Simulate a Wi-Fi Router Buffer System

Model packets arriving at a router with a buffer limit of 10.

Track packet drop rate and average queue occupancy.

4. Priority Queues (M/M/1 with Priority)
Description:
Customers have different priority levels. Higher-priority customers are served first. Can be preemptive or non-preemptive.

Applications: Emergency rooms, customer support.

Project:
Simulate a Hospital ER Queue

Patients arrive with ‚Äúlow‚Äù, ‚Äúmedium‚Äù, and ‚Äúcritical‚Äù severity.

Measure wait time differences among priorities.

5. Network of Queues (Jackson Networks)
Description:
Multiple connected queues where jobs flow from one to another. Each node behaves like an M/M/1 or M/M/c queue.

Applications: Manufacturing systems, computer networks.

Project:
Simulate a Manufacturing Plant with 3 Stations

Parts go from Station A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C.

Simulate processing delays and congestion at each station.

6. Discrete-Event Simulation (General Queues)
Description:
Any queuing system modeled using time-driven events: arrival, service, departure. Supports complex arrival/service patterns.

Applications: Call centers, logistics systems.

Project:
Create a Discrete-Event Simulator for a Call Center

Random arrival and service times.

Simulate day-to-day operations and evaluate staffing needs.

7. Queues with Balking and Reneging
Description:

Balking: Customers decide not to join if the queue is too long.

Reneging: Customers leave after waiting too long.

Applications: Fast food restaurants, online support queues.

Project:
Model a Restaurant Queue with Impatient Customers

Include conditions where customers may leave or refuse to join.

Track loss of business and system performance.

8. G/G/1 Queue (General Interarrival & Service)
Description:
A general model where arrival and service times follow arbitrary distributions.

Applications: Real-world systems where normal distributions apply, not exponential.

Project:
Simulate a Complex Support Ticket System

Use real or generated data for arrival/service times (e.g., normal, log-normal).

Analyze variance impact on wait times and system stability.

üìå Teaching Tip:
Use simpy (Python) or Arena / Simul8 / AnyLogic to simulate.

Visualize queue growth, waiting time graphs, and server utilization.
