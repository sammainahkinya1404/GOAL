ðŸ“¦ Discrete-Event Simulation (DES)
Topic Title: Building a Discrete-Event Simulator from Scratch

âœ… Why Teach It?
It builds foundational understanding behind simpy.

Shows how real-world systems (logistics, networks, manufacturing) are modeled using events like arrival, service, departure.

Perfect for visualizing time-driven systems.

ðŸ§  Core Concepts to Cover:
Concept	Explanation
Event	A change in the system state at a specific time (e.g., arrival, start service, departure).
Future Event List (FEL)	A sorted list of all upcoming events.
Clock	Tracks simulation time.
State Variables	Represent the system (e.g., number in queue, server status).
Simulation Loop	Processes the next event, updates state, advances clock.
