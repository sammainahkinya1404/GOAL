Lab Practical Question: Multi-Service Hospital Simulation with Discrete Events
üí° Scenario:
You are tasked with building a simulation model of a hospital outpatient department with the following features:

Patients arrive randomly (Poisson process).

They first register at one of 2 registration desks (M/M/2).

Then they queue to see a doctor (3 doctors available: M/M/3).

After the doctor, some patients (30%) go to a lab with 1 server (M/M/1); the rest leave.

Include a limited waiting area (K = 10) at the registration and lab.

Patients balk if the registration is full, and renege (leave) if waiting for a doctor takes more than 10 minutes.

Collect and report:

Average waiting time per stage

Total time spent in the system

Number of patients served, balked, or reneged

üõ†Ô∏è Task Instructions:
Implement the full system using simpy.

Apply M/M/c, finite queue, balking, reneging, and DES concepts.

Add statistics collection and generate graphs (e.g., waiting time vs stage).

Simulate for 8 hours (480 minutes).

Export key performance metrics to a CSV file.
