You are tasked with building a simulation model of a hospital outpatient department with the following features

1.Patients arrive randomly (Poisson process).

T2.hey first register at one of 2 registration desks (M/M/2).

3.Then they queue to see a doctor (3 doctors available: M/M/3).

4.After the doctor, some patients (30%) go to a lab with 1 server (M/M/1); the rest leave.

Include a limited waiting area (K = 10) at the registration and lab.

Patients balk if the registration is full, and renege (leave) if waiting for a doctor takes more than 10 minutes.

Output

1.Average waiting time per stage

2.Total time spent in the system

3.Number of patients served, balked, or reneged

Task Instructions
Implement the full system using simpy.

Apply M/M/c, finite queue, balking, reneging, and DES concepts.

Bonus Question
Add statistics collection and generate graphs (waiting time vs stage).

Simulate for 8 hours (480 minutes).
